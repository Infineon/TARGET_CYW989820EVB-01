# CYW989820EVB-01

### Overview

The Cypress CYW989820EVB-01 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth applications using the CYW89820, an Automotive qualified dual-mode Bluetooth 5.2 wireless SoC device. The CYW89820 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth LE/BR/EDR. The CYW89820 delivers up to 10.5 dBm Tx power in LE and BR modes and up to 4 dBm in EDR mode that extends range in applications like Automotive Keyless Entry, Remote Parking, Sensor Control, Wake-up trigger for Telematics units etc. The CYW89820 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the device's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market.
